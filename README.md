# Text Generation using LTSM
**Version 1.0**

Generative model for text using LSTM recurrent neural networks in Python with Keras

--- 

## Installation 

1. Install Python and Keras on your device

2. Download this repository

3. To use the complex (but slow) neural network:

      * $python TextGenerationLTSM1.py
      
      * $python TextGenerationLTSM2.py
   
   To use the faster (but less accurate) version:  
   
      * $python Step1.py  
      
      * $python Step2.py
